I rushed down the stairs from my childhood bedroom in a flurry, pleading for my mothers attention. The sound of my overweight footsteps shook the foundations of the house as an ambitious fifth-grader rapidly lunged step-over-step into the family study. 

“UMMA!?”. Crickets. “Umma?” No answer from her as I stood, chest-high at the doorway. “Umma! Umma! Umma!”, I yelped in quick succession. Still not even a twitch or acknowledgment of my presence as she continued to shuffle through a mountain of paperwork, humming along to her Elvis Presley Best Hit’s playing dimly in the background through cheap garage sale speakers we managed to get our hands on the week prior. “UMMA!”. My prepubescent voice echoed through our thin walls as she finally turned to me to ask, “yes, son?”. 
	
I already knew the answer to the question I was going to ask but I had a simple two-step trick up my sleeve. It had worked last week, why not now? It went something like this: 

Step 1. Beg

Step 2. Beg even harder. 

As promptly rehearsed ten minutes prior, I clasped my hands together, fell to my knees and dug my head into my grass-stained Gap hoodie. “Can you pleasseeeee … “. Pause. “Pleeaasseeee….come with me to get this Nerf Gun?”. More silence. 

The expected silence was a cue for Phase Two. And like a machine gun I began to fire “Please” until my throat went dry and the empty noise of Elvis Presley Greatest Hits clouded the room. Finally, expecting a typical Korean mom’s lecture, I lifted my head ready to debate or bargain, whichever I saw fit. But oddly enough, my mother sat composed, un-wavered by my meticulously planned barrage of pleas. She simply grinned as she pointed to her Dell laptop and happily said, “marshmallows”. 

I rotated the screen to the sight of five or so children, all of whom were most-likely my age and ranged in ethnicity and stature. African-American, White, Asian, Hispanic, you name it. They sat patiently against a typical BuzzFeed backdrop; colorful and ‘Winnie the Pooh-esque. Still confused and eager for an answer, I sternly replied, “Those aren’t marshmallows Mom, those are Mexican kids”. She pressed play.

The game was simple. A BuzzFeed producer placed a marshmallow in front of the children. If you waited, five minutes without eating the marshmallow on the plate you were prized with an additional marshmallow. If the children fell to their cravings, they did not get the reward. I watched intently, making boastful remarks to the chubby kids that failed to withhold their sugar cravings and applauding the kids, who were rather uninterested, that breezed through the challenge. “Easy”, I snarked to myself, “I can not be a fat-ass for five minutes”. 

My 'Raven Baxter’ moment soon followed. The video was a metaphor and marshmallows meant that not only was this a no for my dire need of my current Nerf Gun but it was a no to all of my future spoils. Nerf guns and McChickens I couldn’t have even fathomed I would want. Was this some sort of twisted joke? A simple BuzzFeed video had just turned what was supposed to be a binary question into a constant singularity. I had just lost every thing I never had and I was, to say the least, quite pissed off. 

“But…but this is different from marshmallows, Mom! This is a Nerf Gun, it is going to protect this house!”. I gave it my all, no spoiled brat is going down without a loosely-constructed argument. “What about my straight A’s or the Honor Roll?…I need this!”. It was at this point, my mother had must’ve thought she transcended earth, giving no answer but a tranquil smile on her face and her new favorite answer, “Marshmallows, Andrew!”. 

The obvious lesson here is patience; anybody with half-a-brain could see through that. We have heard this proverb in one way or another a million times throughout our lives. It is in our human nature to act impulsively and we are taught by our family members, institutions or random Reddit accounts accordingly; to save things now so that we can have more later.  And I followed suit, my perspective on marshmallows remained rigid and one-dimensional. But as I graduated college and have begun a new chapter in my adult life, I’ve realized the possibilities to grander, more stoic meanings behind the marshmallow. Meaning that transcends a sweet, campfire snack and the first-world pitfalls of my childhood. 

The thought occurred to me on a late evening drive home from Trader Joe’s, where I imagined a similar marshmallow-eating scenario. In this game, contestants are timed on their ability to eat through a thousand marshmallows; the winner of the race being the contestant to devour through the largest quantity, a game of 'anti-marshmallows' if you will. And unlike the original BuzzFeed video, my twisted version sees that fat kids are rewarded for their immediate action and sense of urgency. 

You see, like all things, marshmallows require balance. Run-of-the-mill marshmallows depict contestants that are tested on their ability for patience and rewarded for inaction while anti-marshmallows require a dose of impulsivity and less deliberation into the future or desired outcome. Think of marshmallows as the boring finance professor mansplaining why you should leverage against your rental property with Moody's AAA-rated munincipal bonds and anti-marshmallows as the Nike ad, telling you to "Just do it". 

And it is upon this notion of anti-marshmallows that holds the foundations to this blog, “overreacted”. I started this blog in hopes of organizing my thoughts and interests. I have a natural natural tendency to hyper-fixate, or ‘overreact’, towards topics, hobbies or seemingly infinite 1 AM rabbit-holes towards anything even remotely peak my interest. Whether that be revisiting my current thoughts towards existing hobbies like snowboarding, distance running, travel experiences or exploring new ones as sports leagues, hot topics or sports leagues, I hope ‘overreacted’ to be the digital hub to share the anti-marshmallows of my life. After all, I am just a guy climbing to conquer the mountain of marshmallows that is life.
